New Years 201* 

Morning on my Block
 after New Years,
Allot of bottles 
next to my flat 
in Berlin, 
God those people 
know to party hard,
on new years day,
Moet, Chardonnay,
 
Pretty viwes that
call me hun .. 
singing all night.  
At the bar next to
sight.

T i wish you where 
here and live your mom,
To get to a club or 
party jam, 
Know some fancy
restaurant in Est,
where we uesd too, 
maybe get a drink
or two, and a big 
sandwich, gosh i was 
so starving.
***
Get back like we used 
too, at that hot wine 
At the skating ring 
at the Royal Platz
Where they used to 
sign carols and skate
all night, what a nice
evening, talking of 
what it could, if i
only knew that technology.
***
I met Hanna there too, 
Talking about HR and 
you. Technology and 
what is seemed to you 
and the most important 
thing was, the dollars 
too, rather than a hot
soup.
***
So i wish to come back,
Better than i used to be.

Holidays in the U.S.A.
***
Nothin better where to stay 
On a californian ranch bought yesterday,
We waited to book that holiday, 
Lucky on booking (.com)  is what
i needed too, 
Get better acoomodations as i read 
my Yahoo (.com)
***
Near a chimney to read my poetry, 
To make feeling more unhappy, 
Cuz "for a year we ain't go
no where Papi"
As i was nervous to say, 
Bonita, i am with you all the way
***
Let's wrap up for tonight of this slay ride, 
Mush those dogs at the nest or even hut, 
Let the slay fly all the way back this night,
***
Let me poor you some champagne, 
You mushed those dogs all that way
Me resting in the back slay. 
***
Get those glasses and lets toast
I am always on time and a good host,
I'll cook a stake and let it roast, 
Pour some "rose" on it and pepper too,
Salt not that good for me and you.
***

 Those big brown eyes
***
I remember before you 
arrived, 
I would recognize you 
would be in a disguise
When you walk down the 
street 
I can hardly feel my 
feet 
***
As i think the snow 
will melt
Before your walk and
the storm will go away
As i know that should
be you in our 
neiborghood alley.
***
I guess even now
The winter snow 
And don't know how 
Your eyes keep comming
up
In that windy snow fall
***
And as i walked, 
I realized that's not
a bluff, 
And there you where, 
In New york, you smart
girl, 
I was stressed you 
freezed 
***
Or next to me, on our
way..
For a coffee shop to
stay, 
To get the frost bite
melt away,
The taxi's where so
slow, 
The big snow which
made your cap 
from Dark brown to 
a winter white
***
Your frozen nose,
which i could feel 
Every time you 
where in my arms 
and let me get 
your scarf untied, 
I remember as i 
keept you warm, 
And get the 
snow off your coat.
***
That coffee shop's
not far 
Will get a blanket, 
at the bar,
Some brownies too, 
As i look at you,
and see them eyes
That blink in them
and your warm soul
I think i am 
confused as you 
where amused
I couldn't recognize 
which are the brownies
And which are your eyes.
***
I may say, that i like
your way, 
That smurf smile and
sparkling eyes,
The way the coat falls
on your thies, 
I think Madam, that
your eyes
Are better that those
brownies we 
ate in those winter 
stormy nights.

And smelled that coffee 
And heard her whisper to mee

Left her a hug just, did some push-ups on the rug
Get some honey and a tea,

Did my projects and an alibi 
To get involved

And no moody to stay stressed 
Cuz you should drink a smoothie.

A poem of last night
***
I hit it up last night, 
Didn't wanna wrestle
Or get in a fight, 
I had doubts and run all night, 
I was all alone but .. 
I hold my hoodie tight
***
Was snowing, 
Wished someone was there, 
I thought of calling you, 
But i had no change to pay, 
To say i wish you where with
me on last years christmas day, 
***
I wanted to show you Times Square 
The lights and things to buy, 
not just stare, 
I thought it was a scam ,
When i got fired for listening 
shazam. 
***
I'll buy you a pizza 
Cuz i have some change 
But i'll rearrange that
after tonight
So i won't have a morning rage 
Or bad headache.

 Another poem of last night 

I hit it up last night, 
Didn't wanna wrestle or
get in a fight, 
Had doubts and run all night, 
Alone in this dark whole 
In front of an old avenue store 
I was cold but had hoodie 
pants and snickears
***
Jogging without any 
judgement in the snow, 
I swear girl i was out
of control, 
I wished i was someone else, 
To tired to see you where 
in fact calling for me, 
***
I need to wake up bitch, 
Stop the scream, i wouldn't
be mean, 
If you pour some drinks to 
you know who 
To get the pay and deliver 
something sweet this 
christmass too 
***
But he did not pay, you 
always disobey 
And now i am in new york 
and walk all alone, 
To cover my harts wholes 
With empty wishes, wish 
i had a dog 
Like our pup Ralph, 
To imagine and see what 
ralph had more sould to mee, 
Than you or our old home 
christmas tree
***
This is no Christmas, wish
i'll stay here until i'm old
In Manhattan, this city 
means the world!
I thought of calling you 
a mut, 
Things to scam a whore of 
what you are 
Getting me fired from the 
melody company
Leave me with spare change 
in my home
***
Calling the police when ill 
Couldn't even get money to
listen to a deezer melody
***
Even shazam could not detect 
You're dirty character or scream
I am going solo on my own, you mean!
Stop with the trial
You black hat. I am in love
and don't say i'm in a bluff, 
I love you, my Alexis choco-puff.

And hear i did and loved

As i did also your hair 
I wished to be there 
and not to bear 
***
The closeup of the pandemia 
to hold your hand and 
have nothing to wear 
as i see you straighthen 
your hair 
***
As i won't dispear 
that i am keep looking 
for position as a programmer 
so i don't hesitate and
demonstrate

first online date 
***
Looked at flights and

In the middle of the year 
to see you and be close
