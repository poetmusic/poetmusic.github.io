 Those big brown eyes
***
I remember before you 
arrived, 
I would recognize you 
would be in a disguise
When you walk down the 
street 
I can hardly feel my 
feet 
***
As i think the snow 
will melt
Before your walk and
the storm will go away
As i know that should
be you in our 
neiborghood alley.
***
I guess even now
The winter snow 
And don't know how 
Your eyes keep comming
up
In that windy snow fall
***
And as i walked, 
I realized that's not
a bluff, 
And there you where, 
In New york, you smart
girl, 
I was stressed you 
freezed 
***
Or next to me, on our
way..
For a coffee shop to
stay, 
To get the frost bite
melt away,
The taxi's where so
slow, 
The big snow which
made your cap 
from Dark brown to 
a winter white
***
Your frozen nose,
which i could feel 
Every time you 
where in my arms 
and let me get 
your scarf untied, 
I remember as i 
keept you warm, 
And get the 
snow off your coat.
***
That coffee shop's
not far 
Will get a blanket, 
at the bar,
Some brownies too, 
As i look at you,
and see them eyes
That blink in them
and your warm soul
I think i am 
confused as you 
where amused
I couldn't recognize 
which are the brownies
And which are your eyes.
***
I may say, that i like
your way, 
That smurf smile and
sparkling eyes,
The way the coat falls
on your thies, 
I think Madam, that
your eyes
Are better that those
brownies we 
ate in those winter 
stormy nights.

A wife i love not as a

but as a client of the bar. 
with love from Buzau Romania, 
to her, his love from 
United States of America, 
New York, bufallo girl as 
does she wrote 
***
I wanna make your mom a 
granny, to deliver her 
first kid honey, 
a girl or a boy, like 
having something similar 
between you and i,
your smile and dense hair,
and brown kind eyes,
and with my my funny smyle 
and clever style.

    <pre>A days work
***
Started to say i woke up 
And smelled that coffee 
And heard her whisper to mee
Stay one more minute to say 
***
Happy birthday honey, where going to America 
Left her a hug just, did some push-ups on the rug
Get some honey and a tea, 
You god, you are the world to me. 
***
Hun i will go to work all day, 
To get some cash for us in US to stay, 
Did my projects and an alibi 
To get involved 
In a US company. 
***
I'll text you i did okay, 
After i sign the paper today.
I got to go, get on my bike, 
I'll be home almost tonight. 
***
Have a great day and drink your coffee
And no moody to stay stressed 
Cuz you should drink a smoothie.

A poem of last night
***
I hit it up last night, 
Didn't wanna wrestle
Or get in a fight, 
I had doubts and run all night, 
I was all alone but .. 
I hold my hoodie tight
***
Was snowing, 
Wished someone was there, 
I thought of calling you, 
But i had no change to pay, 
To say i wish you where with
me on last years christmas day, 
***
I wanted to show you Times Square 
The lights and things to buy, 
not just stare, 
I thought it was a scam ,
When i got fired for listening 
shazam. 
***
I'll buy you a pizza 
Cuz i have some change 
But i'll rearrange that
after tonight
So i won't have a morning rage 
Or bad headache.

 Another poem of last night 

I hit it up last night, 
Didn't wanna wrestle or
get in a fight, 
Had doubts and run all night, 
Alone in this dark whole 
In front of an old avenue store 
I was cold but had hoodie 
pants and snickears
***
Jogging without any 
judgement in the snow, 
I swear girl i was out
of control, 
I wished i was someone else, 
To tired to see you where 
in fact calling for me, 
***
I need to wake up bitch, 
Stop the scream, i wouldn't
be mean, 
If you pour some drinks to 
you know who 
To get the pay and deliver 
something sweet this 
christmass too 
***
But he did not pay, you 
always disobey 
And now i am in new york 
and walk all alone, 
To cover my harts wholes 
With empty wishes, wish 
i had a dog 
Like our pup Ralph, 
To imagine and see what 
ralph had more sould to mee, 
Than you or our old home 
christmas tree
***
This is no Christmas, wish
i'll stay here until i'm old
In Manhattan, this city 
means the world!
I thought of calling you 
a mut, 
Things to scam a whore of 
what you are 
Getting me fired from the 
melody company
Leave me with spare change 
in my home
***
Calling the police when ill 
Couldn't even get money to
listen to a deezer melody
***
Even shazam could not detect 
You're dirty character or scream
I am going solo on my own, you mean!
Stop with the trial
You black hat. I am in love
and don't say i'm in a bluff, 
I love you, my Alexis choco-puff.

Hello Darling Dear
***
I wished today from you 
to hear
And hear i did and loved
your sweater too
As i did also your hair 
I wished to be there 
and not to bear 
***
The closeup of the pandemia 
to hold your hand and 
have nothing to wear 
as i see you straighthen 
your hair 
***
As i won't dispear 
that i am keep looking 
for position as a programmer 
so i don't hesitate and
demonstrate 
i loved you like on the 
first online date 
***
Looked at flights and 
entry nights 
In the middle of the year 
to see you and be close
my dear
