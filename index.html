Help me to win 
my strength
To get pass of the 
holiday of the 
easter eggs
To show up at her 
door tonight
Cause she is a 
glamour and i was 
held in a weekly 
fight

To get that hub 
up and running 
To see my next 
door neibghour 
wife
To get those 
tickets without 
a shiverring 
earthquake or 
calamities
Cause the deputies 
are not responding 
When it comes to 
hunny and i just 
keep fighting, 
the doors are 
lock on werewolf's 
loft.

He banned the 
loft and saled 
the plot
Planted some 
trees to eat 
off all the 
cherries
Left some hints 
without no berry
Oh boy that 
hun is necessary.

Farming camp

A farm is a great deal, 
It takes courage and skill,
To be a food processor every year,
To stay on top of the valley,

To have tractors and cats sitting in the alley,
To have a big familly and money,
To pay for it all takes guts,
To have workers and no rats, 

I invite you for the sake of USA 
To buy this software today,
It will increase your apetite,
Save you money and working fees,
Let's you create more crops and plans trees,
It has sensors and automatization fields,

It can be remotely managed,
When you have a notebook in your spare luggage.
You can also sing or shout. 

"Grain, grain make it rain, place that seed,
making a good deed"

more by our farming top management system 
on my cell phone.

   Food caters

Catering is just so great, 
When you that meal in a plate,
Browsing through your instacart, 
Waiting for the gal and not be apart, 

Serving lunch with that sweethart,
Instacart is not enough, 
When things go tough,
And keeps you safe,
From the environmentals sake.

I am eagger to start the launch
Of that add-on to get that brunch.
nstacart i don't have much money, 
But using my add-on i can order supper
for my honey.
So please be tuned in for the app 
that will be sure in the play store.

    Inside my hart 

    Inside my arms, 
    You'll die with fear,
    If you'll fight
    For the pain to dissapear.

    Glory and will, 
    Don't interfeer 
    In lack of judgement
    To rudimentary blindage.

    Of thoughts of mightness
    As you are some kind of royal highness, 
    That you pay to get stress
    Out of us, just don't fuss.

    I'll waste my time and effort toom
    To be a part of Bundestag,
    When i use just a tag at your front door,
    To open, work and feel the sour.

    Of elements beneath our soul
    To explore your neiborghood and a building lot
    To face the sickness of the weak without a momma
    Not to pay for rent or feel the freedom

    Of a drive on the road cause you won't tell
    Or will just remain friends in common sense,
    To feel patient inside and don't ignite,
    The freedom and peace that makes us happy

    To get outside with a puppy,
    Run spend a dime and buy a coffee.
    Yell scream, and read like we use to be children
    In the library to seek those beautyfull eyes,
    In despise of your sacrifice to us.

在俱乐部的夜晚

听一些流行音乐，
吹一些蒸汽
喝一些

不要做我

去玩流行音乐

粉碎那个G

我正在跟一些团伙
爆炸，这样你就不会挂了，
放置灰尘并燃烧一些轮胎，

晚上出去
***
从我的矮人那里赚钱，
像左撇子一样点亮一支雪茄
抽烟...
[声音：hip hop tzurraii]
我知道纽约的生活很艰难

***
烟雾弥漫
然后你开始疯狂
我什至都不会听到
我和李通电话
***
跟他穿衣服也看
戴上我的钻石耳环
我的钻石戒指和金色iPhone
我的大城市也梦想着
我的虎毛大衣，
李，你应该捡起来，
我病了
而且不知道该花谁
一大堆现金
***
致电豪华轿车接我们
带我们去LaCaféothèque或Coutume，
咖啡店
绕行
在第五大道上
司机随它去吧
已经接我了
我失控了
***
当李喝醉的书我
从纽约出发的航班
比佛利山庄
不用药让您判断
我花了我的钱
***
司机给我预定了一辆保时捷
可转换的顶部
李给我拿了Vertu
如果你不吻
从我。
***
想见我的女孩，
亚历克西斯在酒吧里
大声跳舞
摇那个紧屁股
那个M好骄傲
***
我会在dee​​zer上跳舞
直到我到达现场
李停止锻炼
你不是那个
愚蠢的我
碰我的小偷
当我跳舞的夜晚。
***
给我预定一辆保时捷
敞篷上衣
给我一个Vertu
然后我们会亲吻
***
不要艰难
你会毁了它
我也会带亚历克西斯，
从山上开车
***
到纽约
你知道谁，
也许M
李删掉了
不想打架
或争论是否
得到现金
我会说我不会
就像你说的那样
留胡子
你在想什么

让他们离开关节
尖叫我不会

看着窗户，
itch子我可以抱怨
外面只有雨

New Years 201* 
***
Morning on my Block
 after New Years,
Allot of bottles 
next to my flat 
in Berlin, 
God those people 
know to party hard,
on new years day,
Moet, Chardonnay,
 ***
Pretty viwes that
call me hun .. 
singing all night.  
At the bar next to
sight.
***
T i wish you where 
here and live your mom,
To get to a club or 
party jam, 
Know some fancy
restaurant in Est,
where we uesd too, 
maybe get a drink
or two, and a big 
sandwich, gosh i was 
so starving.
***
Get back like we used 
too, at that hot wine 
At the skating ring 
at the Royal Platz
Where they used to 
sign carols and skate
all night, what a nice
evening, talking of 
what it could, if i
only knew that technology.
***
I met a girl there too, 
Talking about HR and 
you. Technology and 
what is seemed to you 
and the most important 
thing was, the dollars 
too, rather than a hot
soup.
***
So i wish to come back,
Better than i used to be.

Holidays in the U.S.A.

On a californian ranch bought yesterday,
We waited to book that holiday, 
Lucky on booking (.com)  is what
i needed too, 
Get better acoomodations as i read 
my Yahoo (.com)
***
Near a chimney to read my poetry, 
To make feeling more unhappy, 
Cuz "for a year we ain't go
no where Papi"
As i was nervous to say, 
Bonita, i am with you all the way
***
Let's wrap up for tonight of this slay ride, 
Mush those dogs at the nest or even hut, 
Let the slay fly all the way back this night,
***
Let me poor you some champagne, 
You mushed those dogs all that way
Me resting in the back slay. 
***
Get those glasses and lets toast
I am always on time and a good host,
I'll cook a stake and let it roast, 
Pour some "rose" on it and pepper too,
Salt not that good for me and you.

 Those big brown eyes
***
I remember before you 
arrived, 
I would recognize you 
would be in a disguise
When you walk down the 
street 
I can hardly feel my 
feet 
***
As i think the snow 
will melt
Before your walk and
the storm will go away
As i know that should
be you in our 
neiborghood alley.
***
I guess even now
The winter snow 
And don't know how 
Your eyes keep comming
up
In that windy snow fall
***
And as i walked, 
I realized that's not
a bluff, 
And there you where, 
In New york, you smart
girl, 
I was stressed you 
freezed 
***
Or next to me, on our
way..
For a coffee shop to
stay, 
To get the frost bite
melt away,
The taxi's where so
slow, 
The big snow which
made your cap 
from Dark brown to 
a winter white
***
Your frozen nose,
which i could feel 
Every time you 
where in my arms 
and let me get 
your scarf untied, 
I remember as i 
keept you warm, 
And get the 
snow off your coat.
***
That coffee shop's
not far 
Will get a blanket, 
at the bar,
Some brownies too, 
As i look at you,
and see them eyes
That blink in them
and your warm soul
I think i am 
confused as you 
where amused
I couldn't recognize 
which are the brownies
And which are your eyes.
***
I may say, that i like
your way, 
That smurf smile and
sparkling eyes,
The way the coat falls
on your thies, 
I think Madam, that
your eyes
Are better that those
brownies we 
ate in those winter 
stormy nights.

A poem of last night
***
I hit it up last night, 
Didn't wanna wrestle
Or get in a fight, 
I had doubts and run all night, 
I was all alone but .. 
I hold my hoodie tight
***
Was snowing, 
Wished someone was there, 
I thought of calling you, 
But i had no change to pay, 
To say i wish you where with
me on last years christmas day, 
***
I wanted to show you Times Square 
The lights and things to buy, 
not just stare, 
I thought it was a scam ,
When i got fired for listening 
shazam. 
***
I'll buy you a pizza 
Cuz i have some change 
But i'll rearrange that
after tonight
So i won't have a morning rage 
Or bad headache.

 Another poem of last night 

I hit it up last night, 
Didn't wanna wrestle or
get in a fight, 
Had doubts and run all night, 
Alone in this dark whole 
In front of an old avenue store 
I was cold but had hoodie 
pants and snickears
***
Jogging without any 
judgement in the snow, 
I swear girl i was out
of control, 
I wished i was someone else, 
To tired to see you where 
in fact calling for me, 
***
I need to wake up bitch, 
Stop the scream, i wouldn't
be mean, 
If you pour some drinks to 
you know who 
To get the pay and deliver 
something sweet this 
christmass too 
***
But he did not pay, you 
always disobey 
And now i am in new york 
and walk all alone, 
To cover my harts wholes 
With empty wishes, wish 
i had a dog 
Like our pup Ralph, 
To imagine and see what 
ralph had more sould to mee, 
Than you or our old home 
christmas tree
***
This is no Christmas, wish
i'll stay here until i'm old
In Manhattan, this city 
means the world!
I thought of calling you 
a mut, 
Things to scam a whore of 
what you are 
Getting me fired from the 
melody company
Leave me with spare change 
in my home
***
Calling the police when ill 
Couldn't even get money to
listen to a deezer melody
***
Even shazam could not detect 
You're dirty character or scream
I am going solo on my own, you mean!
Stop with the trial
You black hat. I am in love
and don't say i'm in a bluff, 
I love you, my Alexis choco-puff.
