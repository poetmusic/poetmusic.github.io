Last wake up call 

I hit it up last night, 
Didn't wanna wrestle or get in a fight, 
Had doubts and run all night, 
Alone in this dark whole 
In front of an old avenue store 
I was cold but had hoodie pants and snickears

Jogging without any judgement in the snow, 
I swear Irina i was out of control, 
I wished i was someone else, 
To tired to see you where in fact calling for me, 

I need to wake up bitch, 
Stop the scream, i wouldn't be mean, 
If you pour some drinks to you know who 
To get the pay and deliver something sweet this christmass too 

But he did not pay, you always disobey 
And now i am in new york and walk all alone, 
To cover my harts wholes 
With empty wishes, wish i had a dog 
Like our pup Ralph, 
To imagine and see what ralph had more sould to mee, 
Than you or our old home christmas tree

This is no Christmas, wish i'll stay here until i'm old
In Manhattan, this city means the wrld to me!
I thought of calling you a mut, 
Things to scam a whore of what you are 
Getting me fired from the melody company
Leave me with spare change in my home
Calling the police when ill 
Couldn't even get money to listen a melody 
Even shazam could not detect 
You dirty character or scream
I am going solo on my own, stop with the trial 
You black hat. I am in love and don't say i'm in a bluff, 
I love you, my choco-puff.

hello darling dear
i wished today from you to hear
and hear i did and loved your sweater 
as i did also your hair 
i wished to be there and not to bear 
the closeup of the pandemia 
to hold your hand and have nothing to wear 
as i see you straighthen your hair 

as i won't dispear 
that i am keep looking for position as a programmer 
so i don't hesitate and demonstrate 
i loved you like on the first online date 

looked at flights and entry nights 
in the middle of the year 
to see you and be close my dear 
"This is my rhyme for my dear", 

a wife i love not as a impostor 
but as a lover, from Mugurel Cosmin Spineci with love from Buzau Romania, 
to her, his love from United States of America, New York, bufallo girl as does she wrote 
I wanna make your mom a granny, to deliver her first kitten honey, 
a girl or a boy, like having something similar between you and i,
 your smile and dense hair, 
my funny smyle and clever style
