The stairway

God help me to win my strength
To get pass of the holiday of the easter eggs
To show up at her door tonight
Cause she is a glamour and i was held in a weekly fight

To get that hub up and running 
To see my next door neibghour wife
To get those tickets without a shiverring earthquake or calamities
Cause the deputies are not responding 
When it comes to hunny and i just keep fighting, the doors are lock on werewolf's loft.

He banned the loft and saled the plot
Planted some trees to eat off all the cherries
Left some hints without no berry
Oh boy that hun is necessary.
